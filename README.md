# Sample_Regression_Analysis
During my student assistantship, I got consulted on many different issues relating to analytics and descriptive statistics concerning the total teaching hours of the staff, the statistics of the exam results, etc. This case study got commissioned when we needed to change plans for the booking system we use. This is an ad-hoc regression analysis performed to predict the number of bookings we will receive in 2022 and develop a plan to answer for the increasing demand.

Since I dealt with aggregated student information, I either deleted the parts where the names of students are visible, or tacked on a .shape at the end of the data frame variable where it made sense.
